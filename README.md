# Test files for the interview at Breath

The solutions are stored in the components folder:

- Factory status: the dependency queue keeps the status even if an item has two (or more) conditions and at least one of them is inactive --> the step will be kept inactive.
- Habitat Chart: for this solution I had to write a matrix rotator that converts columns into rows.
- Styling select element: styling the raw seelct HTML element is not possible as the task asked for by using simple CSS. For the solution I had to write a transformer JavaScript function that creates a DIV structure from the select element and also added the click handlers. Right now it's enough, as the task was for click events. For better UX more events should be created (keyboard events).
